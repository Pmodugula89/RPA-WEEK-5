Week 5 Assignment: RPA Solution Scaling Plan
Summary Outlines
Monitoring Strategy
Telemetry Emission:
The bot emits structured JSON logs detailing transaction processing status, errors, retry counts, timestamps, and contextual information like function and line number. It also exposes Prometheus metrics counters and gauges for total transactions processed, errors, retries, CPU and memory usage.
Data Storage:
Logs can be streamed to standard output or files. Metrics are exposed on an HTTP endpoint (localhost:8000/metrics) which a Prometheus server scrapes regularly. This keeps monitoring data centralized and accessible.
Visualization and Alerting:
Integrate Prometheus with Grafana dashboards to visualize KPIs such as transaction throughput, error rates, retries, CPU and memory utilization. Alerts triggered on error thresholds or resource spikes to proactively detect issues.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Tracked:
•	Total transactions processed (success/fail count)
•	Error and retry counts
•	Average processing time (can be added via histograms)
•	CPU and memory usage for system health
•	Downtime or failure frequency (tracked via error logs)
Maintenance Plan (Step-by-Step Strategy)
Patch and Release Process:
•	Use GitHub version tags and branch policies. Automate testing and deployments via GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows on push events. Deploy stable releases to production after passing unit and integration tests.
•	Dependency Management: Manage Python dependencies with pip-tools to freeze versions in requirements.txt. Use Dependabot for automated dependency checks and security updates.
•	Scaling Strategy: Scale horizontally — spawn multiple instances of the bot connected to a work queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ). Autoscale infrastructure for workloads 5×, 10×, and 100× using container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) or cloud autoscaling groups.
•	Recovery Plans: Implement retries on transient errors with exponential backoff (code example above). Use dead-letter queues for failed transactions requiring manual review. Include error monitoring and alerting for early issue detection. Health checks with auto-restart for failed bot instances.
ROI Evaluation (Cost-Benefit Model)
•	Synthetic Projections: Example: 10,000 transactions/day initially; scale projections for 50k, 100k, and 1,000k transactions.
•	Cost Per Transaction: Based on CPU seconds per transaction (e.g., 0.05 sec) and infrastructure costs. Include retry overhead (extra processing time).
•	Labor Minutes Saved: Estimate ~2 minutes saved per transaction automated, multiplied by transaction volume.
•	Downtime Avoided & Qualitative Benefits: Reduced errors increase customer satisfaction; faster processing improves service quality; fewer manual interventions lower operational risk.
•	Use generated synthetic logs and batch metrics to validate these assumptions and refine ROI calculations iteratively.
